# example logrotate config file, I usually keep this in
# /etc/logrotate.d/unicorn_app on my Debian systems
#
# See the logrotate(8) manpage for more information:
#    http://linux.die.net/man/8/logrotate

# Modify the following glob to match the logfiles your app writes to:
{{ redmine_home }}/log/*.log {
	# this first block is mostly just personal preference, though
	# I wish logrotate offered an "hourly" option...
	daily
	missingok
	rotate 10
	compress # must use with delaycompress below
	dateext

	# this is important if using "compress" since we need to call
	# the "lastaction" script below before compressing:
	delaycompress

	# note the lack of the evil "copytruncate" option in this
	# config.  Unicorn supports the USR1 signal and we send it
	# as our "lastaction" action:
	lastaction
		pid={{ redmine_home }}/tmp/pids/unicorn.pid
		test -s $pid && kill -USR1 "$(cat $pid)"
	endscript
}
